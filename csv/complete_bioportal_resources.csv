Techniques range from wide field mosaics taken with multiphoton microscopy to 3D reconstructions of cellular ultrastructure using electron tomography. Contributions from the community are welcome. The CCDB was designed around the process of reconstruction from 2D micrographs, capturing key steps in the process from experiment to analysis. The CCDB refers to the set of images taken from the as the Microscopy Product. The microscopy product refers to a set of related 2D images taken by light (epifluorescence, transmitted light, confocal or multiphoton) or electron microscopy (conventional or high voltage transmission electron microscopy). These image sets may comprise a tilt series, optical section series, through focus series, serial sections, mosaics, time series or a set of survey sections taken in a single microscopy session that are not related in any systematic way. A given set of data may be more than one product, for example, it is possible for a set of images to be both a mosaic and a tilt series. The Microscopy Product ID serves as the accession number for the CCDB. All microscopy products must belong to a project and be stored along with key specimen preparation details. Each project receives a unique Project ID that groups together related microscopy products. Many of the datasets come from published literature, but publication is not a prerequisite for inclusion in the CCDB. Any datasets that are of high quality and interest to the scientific community can be included in the CCDB. The goal of the CCDB project is to make unique and valuable datasets available to the scientific community for visualization, reuse and reanalysis.
