Antibodies:  All antibody information comes from the Antibody Registry.  Here the curie prefix being used is ‘AB’

	https://scicrunch.org/resources/Antibodies/search?q=%2A&l=

	https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:AB_90755 which is http://antibodyregistry.org/search.php?q=AB_90755

Organisms: Organisms is the unique item here as this pulls information from a collection of integrated external resources:

Tools/Resources: All tools/resource information comes from the SciCrunch Registry ( https://scicrunch.org/browse/dashboard ).  In the initial pilot the prefixes for these entities were mixed as the registry entries came from many legacy systems (NITRC, INCF, NIF, nlx, OMICS, ...). And this became untenable as it was not easy to decide what registry for a given item was the authoritative one.  So we converted to a generic - non-branded identifier - Scientific Resource:
