    title: "AHFS Pharmacologic-Therapeutic Classification System"
    description: "The AHFS Pharmacologic-Therapeutic classification originated as an adaptation of the drug classification used to organize the University of Michigan's Hospital Formulary of Selected Drugs. The principal change reflected in the 1959 adaptation was the incorporation of a hierarchical numeric structure to the alpha description of the drug classes and subclasses. The AHFS classification allows the grouping of drugs with similar pharmacologic, therapeutic, and/or chemical characteristics in a 4-tier hierarchy. There are 31 classifications in the first tier, 185 in the second tier, 256 in the third tier, and 94 in the fourth tier"

Cell lines contained in CLO are associated with terms from other ontologies such as Cell Type Ontology, NCBI Taxonomy, and Ontology for Biomedical Investigation. A common design pattern for the cell line is used to model cell lines and their attributes, the Jurkat cell line provides ane xample.  Currently CLO contains over 36,000 cell line entries obtained from ATCC, HyperCLDB, Coriell, and bymanual curation. The cell lines are derived from 194 cell types, 656 anatomical entries, and 217 organisms. The OWL-based CLO is machine-readable and can be used in various applications."

The Expedited Process MTA, in which we created a network of institutions that agree to the terms of transfer in advance of a material request, eliminates these delays.  By creating a repository of plasmids and expediting the process for receiving these plasmids, we strive to accelerate the accessibility and pace of scientific discovery."

    description: "EDAM (EMBRACE Data And Methods) is an ontology of bioinformatics operations (tool, application, or workflow functions), types of data, topics (application domains), and data formats. The applications of EDAM are within organising tools and data, finding suitable tools in catalogues, and integrating them into complex applications or workflows. Semantic annotations with EDAM are applicable to diverse entities such as for example Web services, databases, programmatic libraries, standalone tools and toolkits, interactive applications, data schemas, data sets, or publications within bioinformatics. Annotation with EDAM may also contribute to data provenance, and EDAM terms and synonyms can be used in text mining. EDAM - and in particular the EDAM Data sub-ontology - serves also as a markup vocabulary for bioinformatics data on the Semantic Web."

This describes not only the general features of an enzyme, including the EC number (catalytic activity), 3D structure and cellular locations, but also allows for the detailed annotation of the mechanism.

The goals are to standardize these terms and reach consensus regarding their definitions. In this way, we will increase the utility of descriptions of the human phenotype and facilitate reliable comparisons of findings among patients. Discussions with other workers in dysmorphology and related fields, such as developmental biology and molecular genetics, will become more precise. Here we describe the general background of the project and the various issues we have tried to take into account in defining the terms."

INO was initiated by supporting literature mining related to interactions and interaction networks.  INO has been initiated and led by by Dr. Yongqun \"Oliver\" He at the University of Michigan Medical School. INO aligns with BFO.

The need for ontologies that provide a systematic arrangement of available data and allow cross talk across various related domains is gaining momentum. In this backdrop, we have developed a comprehensive ontology on primary and established cell lines-both normal and pathologic. It covers around 400 cell lines. This ontology has been built to include the major domains in the field of biology like anatomy, bio-molecules, chemicals and drugs, pathological conditions and genetic variations around the cell lines. An extensive network of relations has been built across these concepts to enable different combinations of queries. The ontology covers all cell lines from major sources like ATCC, DSMZ, ECACC, ICLC etc. and is built in OWL format."

It is taxon neutral, and can be used for any species, including humans. The classes in the PCO are useful for describing evolutionary processes, organismal interactions, and ecological experiments. Practical applications of the PCO include community health care, plant pathology, behavioral studies, sociology, and ecology. The PCO is complient with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and is designed to be compatible with other OBO Foundry ontologies. "

SO-Pharm enables to represent pharmacogenomic relationships between a drug, a genomic variation and a phenotype trait. In addition, it enables to represent patient and more largely panel included in trials, and populations. SO-Pharm enables the representation of measured items on this patients such as results from the observation of a phenotype trait or of genomic variations. SO-Pharm supports knowledge about pharmacogenomic hypothesis, case study, and investigations in pharmacogenomics. SO-Pharm is designed to facilitate data integration and knowledge discovery in pharmacogenomics. In addition it provides a consistent articulation of ontologies of pharmacogenomic sub-domains."

This would enable scientists to answer new questions, and to answer existing scientific questions more quickly. This will help pharmaceutical companies to model patient-centric information, which is essential for the tailoring of drugs, and for early detection of compounds that may have sub-optimal safety profiles.

WSIO is however independent of the application domain and relevant for any SOAP Web services. If the interaction scenario with a Web service is nontrivial (and incorporates session handling), annotation with WSIO concepts will enable automatic generation of client programs, scripts, or interactive applications with a graphical user interface. WSIO also enables automation of different ways of data transfer and data un-/compression or en-/decoding. We strongly discourage providers from developing complex interaction and data-transfer/compression scenarios, however when needed, WSIO will enable smooth automated interaction with them. Future versions will support more interaction scenarios. WSIO aims to serve also as a means to standardise the complex interaction scenarios within SOAP Web services."
